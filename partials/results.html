    <h2>Results & Findings</h2>
    <p>
        Our experiments with GAN-based text summarization demonstrate several key improvements over 
        traditional extractive and abstractive methods. The model was evaluated on various benchmarks, 
        including fluency, coherence, and summary length accuracy. The results clearly show that GANs 
        have the potential to significantly enhance text summarization tasks.

        <strong>Key Findings:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Fluency:</strong> GANs generate summaries that are grammatically correct and 
        free from many of the syntactic errors seen in baseline models.</li>
        <li><strong>Context Preservation:</strong> The GAN-based model preserves the core meaning and context 
        of the original text more effectively than traditional methods, reducing the risk of generating summaries 
        that distort the meaning of the source material.</li>
        <li><strong>Fewer Redundant Phrases:</strong> GANs are better at avoiding redundancy in the summaries, 
        which is a common issue in extractive summarization techniques.</li>
    </ul>

        Additionally, the model’s performance was evaluated against human-generated summaries, and it was 
        found that in 70% of cases, GAN-generated summaries were preferred over those produced by 
        traditional models. This highlights the model’s ability to produce human-like text.
