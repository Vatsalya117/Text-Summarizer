    <h2>Model Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        The core architecture of our GAN-based model for abstractive text summarization is composed of two 
        neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator is responsible for producing 
        a summary based on the input text, while the discriminator evaluates how close the generated summary 
        is to the actual, human-generated summary.
    </p>
    <p>
        - <strong>Generator:</strong> This is a sequence-to-sequence model, enhanced with attention mechanisms, 
        that generates a summary of the input text. The generator tries to learn the key patterns and features 
        that should be included in a summary, including linguistic fluency and coherence.
    </p>
    <p>
        - <strong>Discriminator:</strong> This network, which can be a binary classifier, determines whether 
        a summary is real (human-generated) or fake (machine-generated). The discriminatorâ€™s feedback helps 
        the generator improve its summary generation in an adversarial setup.

        The adversarial setup allows the generator to gradually improve its summarization capability, as it 
        learns from the feedback given by the discriminator. This leads to summaries that are more coherent, 
        concise, and aligned with human understanding.
