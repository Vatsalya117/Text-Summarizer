    <h2>Research Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has long focused on text summarization techniques, 
        which aim to condense a large body of text into a shorter version while retaining the key information.
        Traditional methods often fall short in creating coherent and contextually accurate summaries.
        This research proposes the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for abstractive text summarization,
        a novel approach that generates human-like summaries rather than extracting key phrases or sentences.

        Our research shows that GANs, which consist of a generator and a discriminator, are capable of learning
        complex language structures, thereby enhancing the quality of summaries. This offers a significant improvement
        over traditional summarization techniques, which often struggle with fluency and relevance.

        The research explores several domains, including news articles, scientific papers, and social media data, 
        and highlights the impact of GANs in generating concise yet informative summaries. By leveraging the 
        adversarial training of GANs, we demonstrate that the model can produce summaries that are more accurate, 
        fluent, and contextually relevant than state-of-the-art methods.
